    "# Customizing embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates one way to customize OpenAI embeddings to a particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is training data in the form of [text_1, text_2, label] where label is +1 if the pairs are similar and -1 if the pairs are dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a matrix that you can use to multiply your embeddings. The product of this multiplication is a 'custom embedding' that will better emphasize aspects of the text relevant to your use case. In binary classification use cases, we've seen error rates drop by as much as 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, I use 1,000 sentence pairs picked from the SNLI corpus. Each pair of sentences are logically entailed (i.e., one implies the other). These pairs are our positives (label = 1). We generate synthetic negatives by combining sentences from different pairs, which are presumed to not be logically entailed (label = -1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a clustering use case, you can generate positives by creating pairs from texts in the same clusters and generate negatives by creating pairs from sentences in different clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "With other data sets, we have seen decent improvement with as little as ~100 training examples. Of course, performance will be better with  more examples."
